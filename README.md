# Introduction

**Linux** is a free and open-source operating system that powers everything from personal computers and smartphones to servers, supercomputers, routers, and embedded devices. At its core, Linux is known for its stability, security, flexibility, and developer-friendliness, making it a favorite among programmers, system administrators, and tech enthusiasts.

### What is Linux

Linux refers to the **kernel** ‚Äî the central part of the operating system that directly interacts with the hardware and manages system resources like memory, CPU, devices, and processes.
However, when people say "Linux," they often mean a Linux distribution (distro), which is the kernel plus essential tools, libraries, and a user interface ‚Äî forming a complete operating system.
But to understand Linux we have to start from Unix.

Popular Linux distributions include:

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu, Debian (user-friendly, general-purpose)</li>
   <li>Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (enterprise environments)</li>
   <li>Arch, Gentoo (customization-focused)</li>
   <li>Kali Linux (security and penetration testing)</li>
   <li>Android (yes, it's based on the Linux kernel!)</li>
</ul>

Studying Linux is more than learning an OS ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding how computers work at a deeper level.

#### History of Linux

The history of Unix dates back to the **mid-1960s**, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric collaborated on an ambitious project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics">MULTICS</a> ‚Äî the Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. The goal was to create a sophisticated, multi-user, time-sharing operating system.

Although **AT&T** eventually withdrew from the project, the ideas behind **MULTICS** deeply influenced computer scientists at Bell Labs. In **1969**, **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie** developed a simpler alternative, initially called **UNICS** (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) ‚Äî a pun on MULTICS. This system was later renamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a>.

Unix‚Äôs importance lies not only in its elegant and modular design, but in how it reshaped the development of operating systems. One of its most groundbreaking moments came in **1973**, when Thompson and Ritchie rewrote the Unix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">kernel</a> in C, a new high-level language they designed. This made Unix highly portable ‚Äî it could be run on different hardware platforms with minimal changes ‚Äî and laid the foundation for modern operating systems.

Over time, Unix became the blueprint for countless OS families, including Linux, BSD, macOS, Android (via Linux), and more. Its philosophy of building small, composable tools that do one thing well continues to influence software design today.

The <ins>Linux kernel</ins> was created in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish computer science student. Frustrated by the limitations of MINIX (a teaching-oriented Unix-like OS), he started developing his own Unix-compatible kernel as a personal project.

On August 25, **1991**, Linus announced his work on a new free operating system kernel in a Usenet post. It was initially small, but quickly gained attention and contributions from programmers around the world.

By combining the Linux kernel with tools from the GNU Project (like compilers, shells, and utilities), it became a full-fledged free and open-source operating system, often called GNU/Linux.

Since then, the Linux kernel has evolved into a massive, modular, and highly portable system, powering everything from servers and smartphones (like Android) to supercomputers and embedded devices.

Today, it‚Äôs one of the largest and most actively developed open-source projects in the world.

#### Linux distros

üß∑ What is a Linux Distribution (Distro)?

A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, bundled with a package manager, desktop environment, libraries, drivers, system utilities, and often a default init system (like systemd).

Distros are tailored for different purposes: general use, servers, security, embedded systems, minimal installations, etc.

# üß≠ Linux Commands(basics)

### Directory

The command line lets you move around the filesystem, inspect directories, and execute actions. Here are the essential commands and concepts for navigating in Linux.

üìÅ 1. Current Directory: <code>pwd</code>

Prints the present working directory ‚Äî where you are in the filesystem.

```shell
pwd
```

Example output:

```shell
/home/yourusername/Documents
```

üìÇ 2. List Files: <code>ls</code>

Shows files and directories in the current directory.

Useful options:

<code>-l</code> (long format)

<code>-a</code> (include hidden files)

<code>-h</code> (human-readable file sizes)

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 3. Change Directory: <code>cd</code>

Changes your current working directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Shortcuts:

<code>cd ~</code> ‚Üí go to your home directory

<code>cd ..</code> ‚Üí go up one level

<code>cd -</code> ‚Üí switch to previous directory

Examples:

```bash
cd ..
cd ~/Downloads
cd /etc

```

üóÇÔ∏è 4. Tree-Like View (Optional): <code>tree</code>

Shows a directory and its contents recursively (you may need to install it).

```bash
sudo apt install tree      # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install tree      # Fedora/RHEL
tree
```

üîç 5. Locate Files & Directories
<code>find</code>: Search in real-time

```bash
find /path -name "filename"
```

<code>locate</code>: Search using an indexed database

First update the database:

```bash
sudo updatedb
```

then:

```bash
locate filename
```

üìå 6. Absolute vs Relative Paths

Absolute path: starts from <code>/</code> (root), e.g.,
`bash /home/user/docs`

Relative path: based on current location, e.g.,

```bash
../docs
```

#### Advanced Navigation

<code>pushd</code> and <code>popd</code> ‚Äî Directory Stack

They let you jump between directories without losing your place.

```bash
pushd /etc       # Save current dir and go to /etc
popd             # Go back to where you were
```

üí° Great for switching back and forth between two locations.

<code>dirs</code> ‚Äî View Directory Stack

```bash
dirs
```

Shows all directories in your stack (used with <code>pushd/popd</code>).

<code>ls</code> with sorting and filtering

```bash
ls -lt           # Sort by modification time
ls -ltr          # Reverse order
ls -lhS          # Sort by size, human-readable
```

üí° Combine with <code>head</code> or <code>tail</code> for top/bottom N files:

```bash
ls -lhS | head -n 5
```
