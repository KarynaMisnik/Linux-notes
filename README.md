## Introduction of Linux

**Linux** is a free and open-source operating system that powers everything from personal computers and smartphones to servers, supercomputers, routers, and embedded devices. At its core, Linux is known for its stability, security, flexibility, and developer-friendliness, making it a favorite among programmers, system administrators, and tech enthusiasts.

### What is Linux

Linux refers to the **kernel** ‚Äî the central part of the operating system that directly interacts with the hardware and manages system resources like memory, CPU, devices, and processes.
However, when people say "Linux," they often mean a Linux distribution (distro), which is the kernel plus essential tools, libraries, and a user interface ‚Äî forming a complete operating system.
But to understand Linux we have to start from Unix.

Popular Linux distributions include:

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu, Debian (user-friendly, general-purpose)</li>
   <li>Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (enterprise environments)</li>
   <li>Arch, Gentoo (customization-focused)</li>
   <li>Kali Linux (security and penetration testing)</li>
   <li>Android (yes, it's based on the Linux kernel!)</li>
</ul>

Studying Linux is more than learning an OS ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding how computers work at a deeper level.

#### History of Linux

The history of Unix dates back to the **mid-1960s**, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric collaborated on an ambitious project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics">MULTICS</a> ‚Äî the Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. The goal was to create a sophisticated, multi-user, time-sharing operating system.

Although **AT&T** eventually withdrew from the project, the ideas behind **MULTICS** deeply influenced computer scientists at Bell Labs. In **1969**, **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie** developed a simpler alternative, initially called **UNICS** (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) ‚Äî a pun on MULTICS. This system was later renamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a>.

Unix‚Äôs importance lies not only in its elegant and modular design, but in how it reshaped the development of operating systems. One of its most groundbreaking moments came in **1973**, when Thompson and Ritchie rewrote the Unix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">kernel</a> in C, a new high-level language they designed. This made Unix highly portable ‚Äî it could be run on different hardware platforms with minimal changes ‚Äî and laid the foundation for modern operating systems.

Over time, Unix became the blueprint for countless OS families, including Linux, BSD, macOS, Android (via Linux), and more. Its philosophy of building small, composable tools that do one thing well continues to influence software design today.

The <ins>Linux kernel</ins> was created in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish computer science student. Frustrated by the limitations of MINIX (a teaching-oriented Unix-like OS), he started developing his own Unix-compatible kernel as a personal project.

On August 25, **1991**, Linus announced his work on a new free operating system kernel in a Usenet post. It was initially small, but quickly gained attention and contributions from programmers around the world.

By combining the Linux kernel with tools from the GNU Project (like compilers, shells, and utilities), it became a full-fledged free and open-source operating system, often called GNU/Linux.

Since then, the Linux kernel has evolved into a massive, modular, and highly portable system, powering everything from servers and smartphones (like Android) to supercomputers and embedded devices.

Today, it‚Äôs one of the largest and most actively developed open-source projects in the world.

## Linux distros

üß∑ What is a Linux Distribution (Distro)?

A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, bundled with a package manager, desktop environment, libraries, drivers, system utilities, and often a default init system (like systemd).

Distros are tailored for different purposes: general use, servers, security, embedded systems, minimal installations, etc.

## üèóÔ∏è Linux System Architecture

The Linux system architecture‚Äôs main levels are:

| Layer                     | Role                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Applications**     | Programs users interact with directly.                            |
| **User Space Libraries**  | Standard libraries apps use to interact with the kernel.          |
| **Kernel**                | Core of the OS, manages hardware, processes, memory, filesystems. |
| **Drivers & VFS**         | Hardware abstraction, handles devices and filesystems uniformly.  |
| **System Call Interface** | Entry point for apps to request services from the kernel.         |
| **Hardware**              | Physical devices managed and accessed through the kernel.         |

üß± 1. Hardware Layer

**What it is:** The physical components of the machine.

**Examples:**

- CPU(Central Processing Unit): performs calculations and controls operations
- RAM: used to store data and programs.
- Disk (HDD/SSD)
- Network interfaces
- GPUs, USB devices

**Role:** Executes instructions, handles data transfer, I/O operations.

Among all hardware, main memory is the most essential. It‚Äôs just a large area that holds 0s and 1s (binary data).

The CPU reads instructions and data from memory, processes them, and then writes results back to memory. All data going to or from devices passes through main memory.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Kernel Layer (Kernel Space)

**The core of the OS**, running in privileged mode and managing all system operations.

Key Components:

| Subsystem                     | Function                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process Scheduler**         | Handles multitasking by scheduling which process runs.  |
| **Memory Manager**            | Manages physical and virtual memory.                    |
| **Device Drivers**            | Interface between hardware and the OS.                  |
| **VFS (Virtual File System)** | Abstracts filesystem operations (ext4, FAT, NTFS, etc). |
| **Network Stack**             | Manages TCP/IP, sockets, and network communication.     |
| **System Call Interface**     | Gateway for user apps to access kernel features.        |

üß© 3. System Libraries (User Space)

**What they are:** Shared libraries providing APIs used by applications to interact with the system.

**Examples:**

- `glibc` (C standard library)
- `libssl`, `libcurl`, `libX11`

**Role:**

- Translate high-level functions (e.g., `open()`, `malloc()`) into system calls.
- Provide abstraction and code reuse.

üíª 4. User Processes / Applications

**What they are:** Programs run by users or the system.

**Examples:**

- CLI: `bash`, `ls`, `top`, `gcc`
- GUI: Firefox, VS Code
- Daemons: `cron`, `sshd`, `NetworkManager`

**Role:** Interface with users and provide application functionality.

üîê 5. Shell and CLI(Command-Line Interface)

> Note: CLI - It's a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system or
> software by typing commands into a terminal or console.

**Examples:** `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`

**Role:**

- Command-line interface to interact with the OS.
- Runs scripts, automates tasks, executes commands.

üì¶ 6. Package Management Layer

**Examples:**

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt`, `dpkg`
- Fedora: `dnf`, `rpm`
- Arch: `pacman`

**Role:**

- Install, remove, and manage software.
- Resolve dependencies and maintain package metadata.

## Root user and sudo

üßë‚Äçüíª Understanding the Root User and <code>sudo</code> in Linux
üîπ What Is the Root User?

The root user (also called superuser) is the administrator of a Linux system.
It has unrestricted access to all files, commands, and system resources.
The root user account: Has UID 0
Home directory: <code>/root</code>
Prompt symbol: <code>#</code> (instead of <code>$</code> for normal users)

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Actions performed as root can change or even break the entire system ‚Äî use it only when necessary.

üîπ Normal User vs Root User
| User Type | Example Prompt | Permissions | Typical Use |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Normal user | `alex@ubuntu:~$` | Limited (own files only) | Daily operations |
| Root user | `root@ubuntu:~#` | Full control of system | System maintenance, administration |

üîπ What Is <code>sudo</code?

**sudo** stands for ‚Äúsuperuser do‚Äù.
It allows a normal user to run specific commands with <ins>root</ins> privileges.
When using sudo, you are asked for your own password, not the root password.
Only users listed in <code>/etc/sudoers</code> can use it.

Example:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

‚Üí Executes the command as root.

üîπ Why Use sudo Instead of Logging In as Root
| `root` Login | `sudo` Command |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Full access all the time | Temporary, per-command access |
| No activity logging | Every action logged in `/var/log/auth.log` |
| Easy to break system | Safer ‚Äî requires explicit privilege each time |

üîπ Useful Related Commands

```bash
whoami        # show current username
sudo whoami   # check if sudo privileges work
sudo -i       # open root shell
exit          # leave root shell
```

## üë• Users and user groups

Linux is a **multi-user** operating system, meaning multiple users can access the same system simultaneously ‚Äî each with their own permissions, files, and privileges.

üîπ What Is a User?

A user is an account that represents a person, service, or process using the system.
Each user has:
Username ‚Üí unique login name
UID (User ID) ‚Üí numeric ID assigned by the system
Home directory ‚Üí user‚Äôs personal working directory (e.g., <code>/home/alex</code>)
Shell ‚Üí command interpreter (e.g., <code>/bin/bash</code>)

You can view all users in the file:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

Example otput:

```bash
alex:x:1000:1000:Alex Smith:/home/alex:/bin/bash
```

Fields (separated by <code>:</code>):

1. Username
2. Password placeholder (<code>x</code>) ‚Äî actual password stored in /etc/shadow
3. UID (user ID)
4. GID (primary group ID)
5. Comment (user‚Äôs full name or description)
6. Home directory
7. Default shell

üîπ What Is a Group?

A group is a collection of users that share access permissions.
Groups simplify administration ‚Äî instead of assigning permissions to individual users, you assign them to a group.

View all groups:

```bash
cat /etc/group
```

Example output:

```bash
developers:x:1001:alex,jordan
```

1. Group name: developers
2. GID (Group ID): 1001
3. Members: alex, jordan

üß∞ Managing Users
‚ûï Add a New User

```bash
sudo adduser username
```

Creates:
A new user account
Home directory <code>/home/username</code>
Default shell <code>/bin/bash</code>

Set password:

```bash
sudo passwd username
```

Or add a new user with these parameters:

```bash
useradd -d homedir -g groupname -m -s shell -u userid accountname
```

| Option         | Description                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d homedir`   | Specify the user‚Äôs **home directory** path.              |
| `-g groupname` | Set the user‚Äôs **primary group**.                        |
| `-m`           | **Create the home directory** if it doesn‚Äôt exist.       |
| `-s shell`     | Define the user‚Äôs **default shell** (e.g., `/bin/bash`). |
| `-u userid`    | Assign a specific **User ID (UID)**.                     |
| `accountname`  | The **username** (login name) of the new account.        |

‚úèÔ∏è Modify a User

```bash
sudo usermod [options] username
```

Common options:
| Option | Description | Example |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `-l newname` | Change username | `sudo usermod -l newalex alex` |
| `-d /new/home -m` | Move home directory | `sudo usermod -d /home/newalex -m alex` |
| `-s /bin/zsh` | Change default shell | `sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh alex` |
| `-aG groupname` | Add to supplementary group | `sudo usermod -aG sudo alex` |

‚ùå Delete a User

```bash
sudo deluser username
```

or (remove home too):

```bash
sudo deluser --remove-home username
```

üë• Managing Groups
‚ûï Add a Group
Following example creates a group with default values:

```bash
sudo addgroup groupname
```

To create a new group account with following parameters:

```bash
groupadd [-g gid [-o]] [-r] [-f] groupname
```

| Option   | Description                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-g gid` | Specify a custom **Group ID (GID)** for the new group.                  |
| `-o`     | Allow creating a group with a **duplicate GID** (used with `-g`).       |
| `-r`     | Create a **system group** (GID < 1000).                                 |
| `-f`     | **Do not fail** if the group already exists; exit successfully instead. |

```

üß± System vs Normal Users
| Type | UID Range | Description |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| System users | 0‚Äì999 | Used by system services (e.g., `daemon`, `syslog`) |
| Regular users | 1000+ | Real people (e.g., `alex`, `student`) |
| Root user | 0 | Full administrative privileges |

## Installing programs

üß≠ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using the Graphical Interface (GUI)
üü¢ Ubuntu Software Center (App Store)

Easiest way for beginners.
GUI tool that installs software from official repositories and Snap Store.

Steps:
Open Ubuntu Software (orange shopping bag icon).
Search for the app (e.g., ‚ÄúGIMP‚Äù).

Click Install.

üëâ Behind the scenes, this uses Snap or APT packages.

üß≠ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using the APT Package Manager (from Repositories)
üü© Install from official repos

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install package_name
```
APT installs <code>.deb</code> packages and handles dependencies automatically.

üß≠ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Using .DEB Packages (manually downloaded)
üü¶ Install downloaded <code>.deb</code> file

You can download apps directly from official websites.
```bash
sudo dpkg -i package_name.deb
sudo apt -f install   # fix missing dependencies
```
or, using APT for simplicity:
```bash
sudo apt install ./package_name.deb
```
üß≠ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Using Snap Packages
üü™ Snap (containerized apps)

Snaps are self-contained apps maintained by Canonical.
```bash
sudo snap install package_name
```
To list or remove snaps:
```bash
snap list
sudo snap remove package_name
```


## üß≠ Linux Commands(basics)

#### Directory

The command line lets you move around the filesystem, inspect directories, and execute actions. Here are the essential commands and concepts for navigating in Linux.

üìÅ 1. Current Directory: <code>pwd</code>

Prints the present working directory ‚Äî where you are in the filesystem.

```shell
pwd
```

Example output:

```shell
/home/yourusername/Documents
```

üìÇ 2. List Files: <code>ls</code>

Shows files and directories in the current directory.

Useful options:

<code>-l</code> (long format)

<code>-a</code> (include hidden files)

<code>-h</code> (human-readable file sizes)

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 3. Change Directory: <code>cd</code>

Changes your current working directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Shortcuts:

<code>cd ~</code> ‚Üí go to your home directory

<code>cd ..</code> ‚Üí go up one level

<code>cd -</code> ‚Üí switch to previous directory

Examples:

```bash
cd ..
cd ~/Downloads
cd /etc

```

üóÇÔ∏è 4. Tree-Like View (Optional): <code>tree</code>

Shows a directory and its contents recursively (you may need to install it).

```bash
sudo apt install tree      # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install tree      # Fedora/RHEL
tree
```

üîç 5. Locate Files & Directories
<code>find</code>: Search in real-time

```bash
find /path -name "filename"
```

<code>locate</code>: Search using an indexed database

First update the database:

```bash
sudo updatedb
```

then:

```bash
locate filename
```

üìå 6. Absolute vs Relative Paths

Absolute path: starts from <code>/</code> (root), e.g.,
`bash /home/user/docs`

Relative path: based on current location, e.g.,

```bash
../docs
```

#### Advanced Navigation

üêß <code>pushd</code> and <code>popd</code> ‚Äî Directory Stack

They let you jump between directories without losing your place.

```bash
pushd /etc       # Save current dir and go to /etc
popd             # Go back to where you were
```

üí° Great for switching back and forth between two locations.

üêß <code>dirs</code> ‚Äî View Directory Stack

```bash
dirs
```

Shows all directories in your stack (used with <code>pushd/popd</code>).

üêß <code>ls</code> with sorting and filtering

```bash
ls -lt           # Sort by modification time
ls -ltr          # Reverse order
ls -lhS          # Sort by size, human-readable
```

üí° Combine with <code>head</code> or <code>tail</code> for top/bottom N files:

```bash
ls -lhS | head -n 5
```

üêß <code>readlink</code> and <code>realpath</code> ‚Äî Resolve symlinks

```bash
readlink -f somefile
realpath somefile
```

Tells you the actual target of a symlink or canonical path.

üêß <code>namei</code> ‚Äî Break down a path

```bash
namei -l /etc/passwd
```

Shows each part of a path and its permissions ‚Äî helpful when debugging permission issues.

üêß <code>stat</code> ‚Äî Detailed file metadata

```bash
stat filename
```

Shows size, owner, permissions, access/modify/change times, inode, etc.

üêß <code>find</code> with powerful filters

```bash
find . -type f -size +100M -name "*.mp4"
```

Find all MP4 files larger than 100 MB.

```bash
find /var/log -mtime -3        # modified in last 3 days
find /home -user yourname      # owned by a user
find . -empty                  # find empty files and dirs
```

üêß <code>file</code> ‚Äî Detect file type

```bash
file filename
```

Helps identify actual file type, not just by extension.

üêß <code>basename</code> and <code>dirname</code> ‚Äî Break up paths

```bash
basename /etc/hosts   ‚Üí "hosts"
dirname /etc/hosts    ‚Üí "/etc"
```

Useful in shell scripts when parsing file paths.

üêß <code>du</code> and <code>ncdu</code> ‚Äî Disk usage

```bash
du -sh *           # See size of items in current dir
ncdu               # (must install) ‚Äì interactive CLI disk usage explorer
```

üêß <code>xargs</code> + <code>find</code> ‚Äî Power combos

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.bak" | xargs rm
```

Deletes all <code>.bak</code> files in the current tree. Safer than a simple <code>rm -r</code>.

#### üóÇÔ∏è File Management

üêß <code>cp</code> ‚Äî Copy files and directories

```bash
cp file.txt backup.txt
```

Copies <code>file.txt</code> to <code>backup.txt</code>.

```bash
cp -r folder1 folder2
```

Copies the entire <code>folder1</code> directory into a new <code>folder2</code> directory.

üêß <code>mv</code> ‚Äî Move or rename files

```bash
mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/
```

Moves <code>file.txt</code> to the <code>Documents</code> folder.

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

**Octal (numeric) mode**

| Octal | Permission |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 7     | rwx        |
| 6     | rw-        |
| 5     | r-x        |
| 4     | r--        |
| 0     | ---        |

```bash
umask 0027
```

New files will default to:
<code>rw-r-----</code> (640) for files
<code>rwxr-x---</code> (750) for directories
Because umask subtracts bits from 666 for files and 777 for directories.

### Redirects and pipes

üêß <code>></code> ‚Äì Redirect Output (Overwrite)

üêß <code>>></code> ‚Äì Redirect Output (Append)

Appends the output to the end of a file instead of overwriting it.
```bash
echo "New line" >> output.txt
```

Adds <code>"New line"</code> to the end of <code>output.txt</code> without removing existing content.

üêß <code><</code> ‚Äì Redirect Input

Takes input from a file instead of the keyboard.
```bash
wc -l < file.txt
```
Counts lines in file.txt by feeding its content as input to wc.

üêß <code>|</code> ‚Äì Pipe

```bash
echo "Another entry" | tee -a log.txt
```
Appends to <code>log.txt</code> (<code>-a</code> means append) while still showing it.

üêß Usage Together

Redirects and pipes are often combined:

```bash
cat access.log | grep "ERROR" | tee errors.log
```
Filters only lines with <code>"ERROR"</code> and saves them to <code>errors.log</code>, while displaying them live.

### Disk usage

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
```
Unmounts by specifying the device instead of the directory.

Typical Workflow

1. Check connected devices:
```bash
lsblk
```
2. Mount a device:
